# FleetDM Host Data Collector for iTop

## Overview

This PHP-based collector integrates FleetDM with iTop, allowing users to synchronize host data from FleetDM into iTop. The collector retrieves host information from the FleetDM API and pushes the data to iTopâ€™s synchronization mechanism.

## Prerequisites

- **iTop**: Make sure iTop is installed and accessible.
- **FleetDM API**: Ensure FleetDM is set up and hosts are enrolled in FleetDM.
- **PHP**: Installed and configured on the server.
- **Composer**: Installed to manage dependencies.

# Configuration

1. **Copy the example file**  
   Copy the example file into your `conf` folder as `params.local.xml`

2. **Update iTop connection settings**  
   Modify the values as follows:
   - `<itop_url>`: Set this to the actual URL of your iTop instance (e.g., `http://localhost`).
   - `<itop_login>`: Set this to the actual username of your iTop admin account (e.g., `admin`).
   - `<itop_password>`: Set this to the actual password of your iTop admin account (e.g., `xxxxxxxx`).

3. **Update FleetDM connection settings**  
   Modify the values as follows:
   - `<fleetdm_url>`: Set this to the actual URL of your FleetDM instance (e.g., `https://fxx.xxxx.xx`).
   - `<fleetdm_token>`: Set this to the actual token for your FleetDM instance (e.g., `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`).

# Configuring the FleetDM Collectors

To configure the FleetDM collectors for different device types (PC, Laptop, and Server), follow these steps:

1. **Update Organization ID (`org_id`)**
   - Set the `org_id` field in the configuration with the actual organization name from your iTop instance.

2. **Update FleetDM ID for Laptops**
   - Locate the label where the `type` is set to `laptop`. 
   - Update the corresponding `fleet_dm_id` with the label ID for laptops from your FleetDM.

3. **Update FleetDM ID for Desktops**
   - Locate the label where the `type` is set to `desktop`.
   - Update the corresponding `fleet_dm_id` with the label ID for desktops from your FleetDM.

4. **Update FleetDM ID for Servers**
   - In the `FleetDMServerCollector` section, locate the label where the `type` is set to `server`.
   - Update the corresponding `fleet_dm_id` with the label ID for servers from your FleetDM.
